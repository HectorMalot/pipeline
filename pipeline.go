// Pipeline is a go library for helping you build piplines without worrying about channel management and concurrency.
// It contains common fan-in and fan-out operations as well as useful `func`s for batch processing and concurrency.
// If you have another common use case you would like to see covered, please (open an issue) https://github.com/deliveryhero/pipeline/issues.
