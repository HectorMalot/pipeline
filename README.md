This package contains utility functions and data structures in golang that I commonly use across all of my projects. Feel free to copy them into your own project as needed or reference this package directly. 

## How to Use this Package
I will be publishing articles referencing the items in this package as they are added to the repo. Below is a list of each article and which files they reference.

### Articles
1. `merge.go` - [API Engineering Patterns in Go](#)

## Feedback
You can find me on twitter and every other social platform [@marksalpeter](https://twitter.com/marksalpeter). I would love to hear from you. If you find a bug in one of my utilities, please let me know in an issue or pr. 

Thanks and Happy Coding!
